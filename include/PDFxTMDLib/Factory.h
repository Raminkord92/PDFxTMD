 * @brief Factory class for creating TMD (Transverse Momentum Dependent) PDF objects

 * This class provides a factory method to create ITMD objects from a specified

 * TMD implementation based on the provided parameters. This class is on top of the GenericPDF class.
 * Note: Users should be aware that the list of different TMD or PDF set is read from the yaml file located in C:\ProgramData\PDFxTMDLib\config.yaml (on windows) or ~/.PDFxTMDLib/config.yaml (on linux). here is an example of the config.yaml file: paths: "C:\\Users\\Ramin\\Documents\\code|C:/Users/Ramin/Pictures"
 * This means that the user can have multiple PDF sets in different directories. The paths are separated by |.  
 * Also by default the current directory and also C:\ProgramData\PDFxTMDLib\ (on windows) or ~/usr/local/share/PDFxTMDLib/ (on linux) are also included.
 * Note: This class by default uses CDefaultLHAPDFFileReader to read the PDF set. If you want to use a different reader, you modify the yaml info file of the PDF set and adding or modify "Reader" field. For interpolation, you can modify the "Interpolator" field. The default interpolator is TTrilinearInterpolator. For extrapolation, you can modify the "Extrapolator" field. The default extrapolator is TZeroExtrapolator
